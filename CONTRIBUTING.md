# Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome. Please follow the issue templates that are already configured. Have in mind the "Why" section (simplicity, OO code with good practices).

* Not mandatory, but nice to have, use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me) for tagging the type of commits you're adding.

If you add a new feature, please add:
* an example for it on the `tests/examples` folder
* unit tests for it on the `tests/core` folder
* an entry in the README explaining how to use it

If you fix a bug, please add:
* unit tests for it on the `tests/core` folder
